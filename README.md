# Lena-Utils-Modules

This will add more functionality to my Main Script.

Currently available:
- Focus Link Module
    - Very useful for support. Will copy on Hotkey press a Focus Link to your Clipboard. Additionally, it will copy a Command- and default link.
- Nitro
    - Will apply the Arena War Nitro to *every* Vehicle.
- Remove Weapons
    - Instead of going to a sub-script list to remove weapons, you can go directly to [Players>All Players>Weapons>Remove Weapons>Heavy Weapons>Railgun (MP)](https://stand.gg/focus#Players%3EAll%20Players%3EWeapons%3ERemove%20Weapons%3EHeavy%20Weapons%3ERailgun%20(MP)) to get rid of those annoying railguns! The same applies to each player as well. You will find it right below the `Give Weapons` list.
